This repository includes two projects from two assignments centred around the analysis and prediction of meteorological data.

## Assignment 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing
In the first assignment, I was given a comprehensive weather forecast dataset. My task was to meticulously identify and summarise the properties of each data attribute, which involved detailed visualisations and data preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality and analysis readiness.

## Assignment 2: Rainfall Prediction Models
The second assignment involved designing multiple classifiers to predict future rainfall. Each classifier was designed in KNIME and the most effective one was reimplemented and further iterated on in Python which is also included in this repo in _classifier.py_.

The final model uses an ensemble method of decision trees known as extreme gradient boosting. Hyper parameter tuning was also implemented in _hyper-tuning.py_ to find the best hyper parameters which are used in the final model.

## Requirements to run
This project has been tested with Python 3.11 along with the following packages:  
numpy  
pandas  
seaborn  
xgboost  
matplotlib  
scikit-learn
